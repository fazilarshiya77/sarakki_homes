 * Role-based authorization for the CRM's API routes.
 *
 * SECURITY: previously every /api/admin route checked only "is there a
 * session?", which meant any signed-in staff member — including a
 * SALES_EXECUTIVE — could delete listings, edit site-wide settings, or
 * create new ADMIN accounts. Authentication is not authorization; this
 * module adds the missing second half.
 *
 * Middleware (src/middleware.ts) is the outer gate: it blocks anonymous
 * requests to /admin and /api/admin entirely. These helpers are the
 * inner gate, enforcing *which* signed-in staff may do *what*. Both
 * layers are required — middleware can't see route-specific intent
 * (a GET list vs a DELETE), and a route handler shouldn't assume the
 * middleware ran.
